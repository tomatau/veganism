# Guide to Vegan

### 1. Digestive Health

- enzymes
  - 30% raw food in diet
- microbiome
  - high dose multi-strain probiotic
  - probiotic rich food. e.g. sourcrout
- stomach acid
  - 1-2 tbps apple cider vinegar a day

- if there are problems, fibre from food ferments
- want short chain fatty acids

### 2. Metabolism

- how body breaks down food into energy
- mitocondria controls metabolism
  - break down glucose to:
    - adenazine triphosphate
    - adenazine diphosphate
    - (energy currency in body)
  - health depends on:
    - CoQ10
    - L-Carnitine
    - Magnesium
    - Omega 3 Fatty Acids
    - B Vitamins
  - health can come from:
    - Nuts, seeds, asparagus, beetroot, garlic, sprouts, almonds, black beans, marine phytoplankton (EPA and DHA)
  - will struggle to lose weight

### 3. Insulin

- level goes up after carbs and fat, then back down
- processed sugars and fat diet raises it more
- if stays high, gain weight
  - Intramyocellular Lipids
  - Type 2 Diabetes (fat blocks glucose)
- _body only burns fat when insulin is low_
- not carb net effect...
- high carb, moderate fat to keep insulin low?

### 4. Cortisol

- made by adrenal glands
- stress hormone in the body
- if too high, impedes and impacts:
  - digestion
  - metabolism
  - insulin
- keep it low:
  - walk for 35 - 45m per day
  - meditation

- get equalised:
  - on a plant based diet
  - liver at optimal function
- detox body of hormone mimickers
  - xeno-estrogen
- beets and brocolli help the liver with stage 2 detox
