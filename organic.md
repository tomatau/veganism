# Permaculture

## Feeding everyone

- 40% is wasted
  - have enough to feed 14bn
  - 4200kc/day

### Eu organic regulations

https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32007R0834&from=EN

Article 12.1.b
the fertility and biological activity of the soil shall be maintained and increased by multiannual crop rotation including legumes and other green manure crops, and by the application of livestock manure or organic material, both preferably composted, from organic production;

## GMO (conventional)

_pro_

- increased yield (20-30% more)
  - ?how is organic yield measured, single crop is wrong
- decrease use of chemical pesticides
- dencreased incesticides
- chemicals to decrease weeds and have less "tilling"
- only 1 tractor pass
  - less soil compaction
  - less fuel cost

_con_

- tends towards monoculture
  - soil destruction
  - requires new machinery
  - no cover crops, no rotation, not laying fallow
  - soil can't fight off desease
- increased use of herbicides
- coincide with chemicals
  - soil destruction
  - harms bees
- monoculture didn't occur naturally at all

# Organic

_pro_

- tends towards multi-culture
  - better soil health from practices
  - better bee health
    - pollen -> nectar -> more pollenation -> more yields

_middle_

- might tend towards
