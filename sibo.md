# SIBO

## Glossary

## Research

- emerged over last 10 years

**SIBO and IBS: A Bridge**

- Upto 84% of people with IBS and bloating
  - SIBO is underlying cause

## General Overview

- types of sibo:
  - just bacteria in small intestine
  - stomach acid problem
    - need low acid in stomach to break down food
    - otherwise, undigested food enters SI

## Symptoms

- bloating after meals
- fibre, carbs get fermented in SI
- constipation diarhea
- probiotics make it worse
- seliac, gluten sensitivity but doesn't improve much
- aenemia
- can be in conjunction with:
  - stomach acid issues
  - digestive enzyme issues
  - oxolate, hystamine, salisolate issues
  - leaky gut

## Diagnosis

- Stool test
  - might pick up yeast issue in gut
  - bloating and cramping, take in conjunction with SIBO
  - looks at:
    - digestion and absorbtion
    - gut immunology
    - metabolic aspects of gut
    - microbiology
- Organic Acids test
  - pick up false negative for yeast from stool test
    - would show high levels of aribinose (bi-product of yeast)
  - cherry on cake to figure out issues
  - looks at:
    - gut flora
    - body breaks down oxilates
      - might suggest greater food intolerances
    - mitocondrio produce energy
    - nuero transmitters firing correctly
    - data on about 80 different metabolic process'
- SIBO test
  - fat malabsorbtion
  - nutritional deficiencies
- Combination of all three

## Dangers

- can become hyper or hypo thyroidism
- other food intolerances

## Treatment

- herbal antibiotics are more efficient but slower?

1. lactulose breath test
  - measure methane and hydrogen in breath
  - should go through bowells
2. if possitivie:
  - restricted diet such as SED or low FODMAP
  3. if oxolate, hystamine, salisolate issues
    - then low FODMAP -> then organic acids test
      4. then if high oxolate and sibo:
        - then low FODMAP and low oxolate
      5. then if hystamine issues:
        - avoid probiotics
  6. kill of with antibiotics
    - if an overpopulation of basina species
      - use berberine, not oregano
  7. slowly increase carbs,fibre,etc...

## Antibiotics

- herbal:
  - allicin
  - berberine
  - oregano
  - neem
  - ...
- refaxomin is safer as non-herbal
